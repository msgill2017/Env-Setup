Make sure you have ruby, gem and bundler installed.

Goto to project directory

1. bundler gem project_name --test =rspec 
note: like rspec for testing 

2. cd project_name

3. Read Readme.md file 

4. Fix TODO words from project_name.gemspec

5. bundle install

6. bin/setup

7. rake spec
(fix the error or delete that test)

8. git add. (I hope you have git already install and setup)

9. git commit -m "Initial Commit"

if you want to include init.rb in root of the project as a app starting piont

1. make init.rb file

Inside init.rb file write following code:
APP_ROOT = File.dirname(__file__)
$:unshift(file.join(APP_ROOT,"lib"))
require "project_name"    # main file in lib dir of your project

#If you have error no file then try following code

Load_path << File.dirname(__file__)
APP_ROOT = File.dirname(__file__)
$:unshift(file.join(APP_ROOT,"lib"))
require "project_name"    # main file in lib dir of your project
